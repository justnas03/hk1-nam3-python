This repository contains solutions to various programming exercises in Python. The exercises are divided into two categories: HW3 and HW4.

**HW3**

* `bai1.py`: Sorts a string of words and prints them in alphabetical order.
* `bai2.py`: Converts binary numbers to decimal and prints them.
* `bai3.py`: Counts the number of alphabetic characters in a string and prints the count.
* `bai4.py`: Capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string and prints the result.
* `bai5.py`: Counts the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in a string and prints the counts.
* `bai6.py`: Identifies prime numbers in a string and prints them.
* `bai7.py`: Counts the occurrences of each word in a string and prints the word counts in alphabetical order.
* `bai7_bis.py`: Similar to `bai7.py`, but prints the word counts in a different format.

**HW4**

* `bai1.py`: Demonstrates string comparison vs integer comparison for sorting.
* `bai2.py`: Filters elements from a list based on their indices.
* `bai3.py`: Removes duplicates from a list.
* `bai3_b.py`: Removes duplicates from a list using a set.
* `bai4.py`: Counts the occurrences of each element in a list and prints the counts.
* `bai4_b.py`: Counts the occurrences of each element in a list using a dictionary.
* `bai5.py`: Asks the user to input elements into a list.
* `bai5_b.py`: Continuously asks the user to input elements into a list until a specific value is entered.
* `bai6.py`: Finds common elements between two lists.
* `bai6_b.py`: Finds common elements between two lists using a set.

These exercises cover various aspects of Python programming, including string manipulation, list operations, and conditional statements.
